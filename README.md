### What I learned

This is my first react project so it was challenging but with a to-do attitude everything is possible.
Learned alot and increased muscle memory and feeling pretty condident in writing react code.
This project does not use complex JS so most of my focus my on the development process and writting css.

### Continued development

In the next project I will keep using react and I hope I can change it into a smooth process. 
I would love to use external libraries with react in the coming projects.
Use state and other complex topics in my projects.
